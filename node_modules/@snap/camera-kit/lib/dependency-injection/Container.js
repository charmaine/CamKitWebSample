/**
 * A Container of values, indexed each by a unique token, which can be used throughout CameraKit. This is how CameraKit
 * implements simple dependency injection.
 *
 * Dependency injection is a way to decouple the *use* of a dependency from the *creation* of that dependency. This
 * improves modularity and re-usability, since components only care about the *interfaces* of dependencies (since that
 * determines their use) and not about their concrete creation. New implementations of a particular dependency may be
 * provided without the need to change any of the consumers of that dependency.
 *
 * There are a few commonly-used terms used when talking about dependency injection:
 *
 *   - Container (or Injector): Maintains a registry of all available Services and understands how to create them.
 *   - Service: Anything that can be provided by the Container is called a Service – this can be a value of any type.
 *   - Token: Each Service is associated with a unique name, or Token. In order to obtain a Service from the Container,
 *     the consumer must provide the Token corresponding to that Service.
 *   - InjectableFunction: Services are created by InjectableFunctions. When adding a Service to a Container, the
 *     Service provider gives the Container a InjectableFunction which, when called will return the Service. These
 *     InjectableFunctions may themselves use other Services, which will be passed to them as arguments.
 *
 * Services are, by default, singletons – that is, each call to `get()` a particular Service will return a reference
 * to the same value. In other words, InjectableFunctions are only invoked once. If multiple instances of a Service are
 * desired, a new Container can be created using the `copy([Token])` method – passing a Token to this method forces the
 * new Container to recreate the corresponding Service (the InjectableFunction will be invoked again). We say that the
 * Service is then "scoped" to the new Container.
 *
 *
 * One common downside of many dependency injection implementations is that the dependency graph formed by the various
 * Services can only be validated at runtime. That is, if a dependency is missing or a circular dependency is found, the
 * developer must wait until runtime to discover the error. These errors can often be confusing and hard to debug.
 *
 * This implementation eliminates this issue by moving these sorts of errors to compile time. If an unknown dependency
 * is used in a InjectableFunction, for example, the code simply won't compile.
 *
 * To achieve this, we do lose the ability to implicitly define the dependency graph, as is common with many dependency
 * injection frameworks that employ decorators to define Services and their dependencies. Instead, the dependency graph
 * must be constructed explicitly, step-by-step, via successive calls to the `provide()` method. This is a suitable
 * trade-off for CameraKit, as there are a relatively small number of Services.
 *
 * Here's a simple example of Container usage:
 * ```ts
 * const fooFactory = Injectable('Foo', () => new Foo())
 * const barFactory = Injectable('Bar', ['Foo'] as const, (foo: Foo) => new Bar(foo))
 * const container = Container.empy()
 *   .provide(fooFactory)
 *   .provide(barFactory)
 *
 * const bar: Bar = container.get('Bar')
 * ```
